            Targeted Email Attack: 
            Targeted refers to the nature of the attack being destined for a specific organization or industry. 
            Email refers to the medium by which the attack is done. An example of this is an email containing malware to 
            steal the data of a certain company. A popular type of targeted email attack is called spear phishing. 
            It involves research on the victim, and tailoring the email to them.
