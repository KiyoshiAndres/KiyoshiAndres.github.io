        <title>Lagrange Multipliers</title>
        <p>
         For some reason, the method of Lagrange Multipliers shows up frequently in entrance exams to 
         universities in Japan. This method helps with finding the maxima and minima of a function 
         <m>f(x_0,\ldots,x_n)</m> given some constraint <m>g(x_0,\ldots,x_n)=k</m>.

        <title>Integrals</title>
        <p>
            There's various methods of solving integrals that are tested in Japan. The main ones I can think of are 
            using the Residue Theorem, differentiating under the integral sign, and change of variables. Change of variables will be treated 
            elsewhere.
